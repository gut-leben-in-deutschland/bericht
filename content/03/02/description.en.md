The early school leavers indicator measures how many young people between the ages of 18 and 24 have **at best** a **basic secondary school qualification** (secondary level I).

It helps to detect risks with regard to young people's job market and income-earning potential. 

These young people have no qualifications other than the secondary level I certificate and are no longer in school or a training programme.

The at-risk group of early school leavers should not be confused with the risk group of **school dropouts** who have no secondary school certificate. The school dropout rate in 2014 was 5.8 per cent.

The data is based on the Microcensus carried out by the Federal Statistical Office.
