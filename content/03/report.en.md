<!-- Prologue start -->

Good education is of course vital for everyone, but it also provides the foundation for a knowledge-based society. Equal access to education, well-equipped schools, the latest learning content and opportunities for lifelong learning – in the national dialogue, this is what people believed to be the foundation of wellbeing. Many people criticised the federal structure of the educational system.

## Education – the key to a good life

<!-- Quote text='A federal school system makes no sense anymore. We have to get rid of all this regionalism; I don’t see any reason why we should have different school-leaving certificates.' source='from the national dialogue event of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy in Magdeburg on 7 July 2015' -->

Education helps people to find their direction in life and make sound judgements. Education is also vital for a competitive economy education, getting a good job and earning a secure income.

The **proportion of persons with at least secondary school graduation** indicator shows how many people have at least completed **vocational training or gained a university entrance qualification**. It measures a country's performance in education - i.e. the educational level of a society and therefore approximates the quality of the German education system.

Anyone who gains a university entrance qualification or completes vocational training in Germany today has good opportunities in the job market. In 2015, almost nine out of ten people aged 25 to 64 in Germany held at least one of these qualifications – six per cent more than the [OECD average](http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888933396529). The share of women with at least secondary school graduation is now slightly above the share of men with that qualification.

Education is one of the key **prerequisites for the integration of migrants**. Here too, there has been a **process of catching up** in the years up to 2014. The proportion of migrants who have gained a university entrance qualification or completed vocational training has increased significantly in the younger age groups. However, there is still a clear gap between people with and without migration backgrounds.

Article 30 of Germany’s Basic Law (*Grundgesetz*) stipulates that education is primarily the responsibility of the federal states. The federal government supports the states and students in Germany with a wide range of measures, such as the expansion of early childhood education and all-day schooling. At the 2008 education summit, the federal and state governments committed to increasing their total expenditure on education, science and research to 10 per cent of GDP. The federal government is committed to this ambitious goal.

## Identify and reduce risks at an early stage

The course of one's educational success is often set at an early age. **A lack of school or vocational qualifications** leads to a lack of opportunities in the labour market. This was also discussed in the national dialogue. Some young people have difficulties getting started on the educational path. They need targeted support.

<!-- Quote text='Education must be guaranteed – regardless of income.' source='from the national dialogue event of the Bertelsmann-Stiftung in Gütersloh on 8 May 2015' -->

The **risk group of early school-leavers** serves as an indicator here. They are between 18 and 24 years old and leave school or a training programme with only lower secondary education or less, and they are no longer in school or a training programme.

<!-- ColumnLeft start -->

Their numbers have dropped over recent years, from around 13 per cent in 2003 to less than 10 per cent in 2015. However, at above 10 per cent young men in Germany are at slightly greater risk than young women (9.5 per cent). With this, Germany has achieved one of the core targets of the Europe 2020 Strategy for Employment and Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth.

[Across Europe](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&init=1&language=en&pcode=t2020_40&plugin=1) the number of early school-leavers has fallen from more than 16 per cent to just under 11 per cent. Hence, Germany is below the European average in 2016.[^1]

There are also fewer early school leavers among young migrants in Germany. In 2005 almost one in four migrants was in this group, but by 2014 this had fallen to one in six.

Despite this improvement, there is still a clear gap between people with and without migration background. Special efforts have to be made to ensure that **education as a driver of integration** is effective, particularly because many refugees with little formal education have sought asylum in Germany in 2015 and 2016.

With its Quality Offensive for Teacher Training (*Qualitätsoffensive Lehrerbildung*), the government is trying to help those who are responsible for the education of the future. Disadvantaged children, teenagers and young adults receive services from the Education and Participation Package (*Bildungs- und Teilhabepaket*), the government's educational support programme, along with other initiatives such as Culture is Strength. Education Alliances (*Kultur macht stark. Bündnisse für Bildung*).

## Equal opportunities for all

Educational equity is one of the topics that was hotly debated during the national dialogue. People agreed that when it comes to marks and qualifications, fairness is paramount. Wherever possible, every child should have equal opportunities in the educational system. But studies show that the educational success of children in Germany is not always based on their performance, but also on their background. In Germany there is a strong relationship between the educational attainment of parents and their children.

<!-- Quote text='It’s important to me that in Germany as well, every child, regardless of his or her social background, should have the opportunity to pursue the type of education that will help them achieve their full potential.' source='from an online response submitted on 22 August 2015' -->

The **educational mobility between parents and children** indicator compares the **highest** general **school-leaving qualification of the parents with that of their children**.

In Germany there is a strong **relationship between parental levels of education and those achieved by their children**. Seven out of ten children whose parents have a university or university of applied science entrance qualification also gain this qualification. The proportion of young people who leave the education system with no formal qualification is very low in these families.

On the other hand, the evidence shows that many children in Germany make an advancement in the educational system. In fact, upward educational mobility is currently strongest in educationally disadvantaged families: More than 85 per cent of these children leave school with qualification and almost 23 per cent even gain a university or university of applied science entrance qualification. If we look back at the last 20 years, the **trend is clearly positive**. In 2015, one in four children with parents who had no school-leaving qualifications gained their university entrance certificate. Twentyone years earlier, it was only one in thirteen.

There is still a lot to do, as it is still the case that one in seven children from educationally disadvantaged households leave school without qualifications and hence have fewer opportunities when it comes to finding good jobs, earning a good income – and, in short, having a good life.

In families with a migration background the picture is a mixed one. Even if parents have gained university entrance qualification, above-average numbers of their children gain only basic secondary school certificates or leave school without any qualification. But it is pleasing to see that above-average numbers of children with a migration background whose parents have no school qualification have gone on to gain basic secondary school qualification or university or applied university entrance qualification. 

Overall, it remains a top priority to weaken the relationship between social background and educational achievement.

It is only possible to gain a comprehensive picture of educational mobility if we first look at the overall educational trajectory of a young person. Vocational and academic qualifications should be viewed alongside general school qualifications. This is particularly important for illustrating the internationally recognised system of dual education and its important contribution to low youth unemployment and opportunities for young people.

With the Federal Training Assistance Act (*BAföG*), the federal government ensures that young people can afford a good education regardless of their parents' income. Since 2015, the federal government has been the sole funder of the BAföG. In autumn 2016, the grants were increased by 7 per cent.

## Life-long learning  

Education does not stop with school, vocational training or a college degree. More and more people want to continue learning – for professional reasons, but also for their own personal development. From their own experience, the participants in the national dialogue mainly took a positive view of **further education**.

<!-- Quote text='I think that life-long learning offers the greatest opportunities today – especially in our digitised world.' source='from the national dialogue event of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy in Magdeburg on 7 July 2015' -->

The indicator **participation in further education** shows the proportion of **18 to 64-year-olds** who have participated in **a company-related, individual profession-related or non-profession-related further education programme over the last 12 months**. 

```chart
03-04-a
```

In 2014, this involved more than half of all people in the 18-64 age group. In 2007 only 43 per cent of this group participated in further education. The increase affected all age groups, but was particularly prevalent in the age group 25-34 and the age group 55-64 years, at more than 10 percentage points. Lifelong learning is more important than ever in light of technological advances and an aging society.

**Companies are the most important providers for further education** in Germany. 70 per cent of all further education is company-related. Profession-related further education activities account for 13 per cent of all further education, while 17 per cent are non-profession-related activities. The focus of the training activities varies according to the type of further education. Company-related and individual profession-related further education generally revolves around **economy, work and law**, while non-profession-related further education mainly involves training on languages, culture and politics.

Federal funding programmes such as the Education Subsidy (*Bildungsprämie*) and the Upgrading Training Assistance Act (*Aufstiegs-BAföG*) open up new perspectives for adults who want to participate in further education. The federal government also offers a hotline for citizens who need advice about further education.
